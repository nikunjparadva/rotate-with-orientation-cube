Neat little coding experiment to try to achieve a 3D effect on Android using 
the orientation sensor. You can see a YouTube video of this code in action 
here:

There's also a follow up where a whole scene rotates here:

It was inspired by this head tracking video:

Not all Android devices have front facing cameras, so I was wondering how well 
using the orientation sensor for this felt. You can't track the user's head, 
but you can track the orientation of the phone. This lets you turn the model 
when the phone is turned, as if it were a 3D object you were holding in your 
hands.

The code is mostly the very excellent ports of the NeHe OpenGL tutorials with 
a few brutal changes. You can see the originals here:
